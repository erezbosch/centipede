### Features
* Use arrow keys and spacebar to move and shoot.
* Or use the mouse to move and shoot.
* There's a centipede.
* You can shoot at it.
* There are mushrooms. You can shoot them too.
* When a centipede segment is shot, it spawns a mushroom in its place.
* Sometimes when you destroy a mushroom, it'll spawn a powerup.
* If you pick up a green powerup, it'll increase your firing rate, shot speed or
number of shots.
* If you pick up a red one, it'll decrease one of those things.
* Sometimes a star looking thing will come out of the wall and chase you.
* Sometimes a different star looking thing will drop from the ceiling and add
mushrooms as it goes.
* If you run into something that's not a mushroom, you'll lose a life.
* Once you're out of lives, you lose, and you can click or press space to play
again.
