### Features

* There are mushrooms. You can shoot them too.
* When a centipede segment is shot, it spawns a mushroom in its place.
* Sometimes when you destroy a mushroom, it'll spawn a powerup.
* If you pick up a green powerup, it'll increase your firing rate, shot speed or number of shots.

* Sometimes a star looking thing will come out of the wall and chase you.
* Sometimes a different star looking thing will drop from the ceiling and add mushrooms.
